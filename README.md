# This Project is Discontinued

Unfortunately this project is discontinued until further notice. 

Please consider using Filemail's [CLI](https://www.filemail.com/apidoc/FilemailLibs.aspx) for your scripting needs. You should be able to wrap the CLI in a subprocess.

Welcome to pyfilemail's documentation!
=======================================

Pyfilemail is a command line tool and API for sending and recieving files with [Filemail](https://www.filemail.com) based on [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) and filemail's [API](https://www.filemail.com/apidoc/ApiDocumentation.aspx).

To avoid nagging about API KEY you should register and get one [here](http://www.filemail.com/apidoc/ApiKey.aspx). If you register for 
a paid plan you unlock all features and will be able to add/delete/update your  ransfers/contacts/group/company settings.
Without registering you'll still be able to send files as a free plan user but remember to use the `--free` argument in the command line tool.

For more info on the different plans please go to [Filemail](https://www.filemail.com)

I've tried to keep this api as simple as possible and rely on filemail's own validation of data to keep you all in check :) The reason for this is that I don't work at filemail and have no insight in what validation they have for the data passed. It also saves me a lot of head ache writing rock solid validation code and I think this is a more flexible way of doing it if the Filemail team decides to change the API in any way.

Appart from `pyfilemail.User` and `pyfilemail.Transfer` classes, all return objects from filemail are `dict` objects based on json responses.

So far this has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04. I'll try to get my hands on a Windows and OSX machine and addapt the code to make sure it works there as well.

API documentation is available at [readthedocs](http://pyfilemail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Any feedback is more than welcome and please report bugs through [github](https://github.com/apetrynet/pyfilemail/issues)

Installation
============

```
pip install pyfilemail
```

Disclaimer
==========

I use this software myself and have not yet experienced broken files, but I take no responsibility for the files sent or received using `pyfilemail` whether it comes to content or state of files passing through. Pyfilemail is still work in progress and parts of the API might change as I develop and test it further.

Command line example
====================

```
pyfilemail \
--from myemail@somedomain.com \
--to lucky.b@receiver.com \
--free \
--subject "Amazing document!" \
--message "Have you seen how amazingly big this document is?" \
--payload /path/to/file.ext /path/to/folder/
```

Add API KEY
===========

You can add the API KEY to the local config file with the `--add-api-key` argumet.

```
pyfilemail --add-api-key YOUR-API-KEY-FROM-FILEMAIL
```

netrc
=====

You may use a .netrc file to store login information. Make sure you restrict access to only allow your own user to read it.

```
#$HOME/.netrc example:
machine yourfilemailuser@email.com
        login yourfilemailuser@email.com
        password topsecretpassword
```
